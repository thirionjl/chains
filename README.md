# Chains

Mini machine learning library centered around optimizing a cost function specified as a [computation graph](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/). Optimization is done by computing partial derivatives by repetitive application of the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule). Hence the name.


Originally created taking while following coursera's [deeplearning.ai course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) but I wanted a more "from scratch", "generic" and advanced implementation of the course exercices.
